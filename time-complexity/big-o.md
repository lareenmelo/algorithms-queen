# big o notation

### what is big o notation?
In short, big o notation is used to find out how fast an algorithm is.

Big o notation is the rate of growth of our algorithms runtime when it's handling really big input. If the number of operations that our algorithm performs is affected by the size of our input this can potentially affect the efficiency of our algorithm. Sometimes, it's inevitable, but other times this is a metric used for improvement and/or tradeoffs. 

Big O establishes the worst case scenario of an algorithm.

### most common big o runtimes
 - O(log n)
 - O(n)
 - O(n log n)
 - O(n^2^)
 - O(n!)
