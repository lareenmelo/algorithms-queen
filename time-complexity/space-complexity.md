# space complexity

## what is it?
`space complexity` refers to space in memory used by our algorithm at run time. `Space complexity` holds both, the `auxiliar space`(*the space required by an algorith, variable definition, operations, etc...*) and the input size by definition. So not only we care about the amount of space we'll need to execute the algorith, but how much space will it need depending on the input.

`Space complexity` is also expressed in terms of `big o notation`
