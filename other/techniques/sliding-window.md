# sliding window
The sliding window technique is used to solve problems over a defined window size of a given array, list, or any other linear data structure.
 
### how to spot a potential solution using this technique...
1. If it's a contiguous/linear data structure (arrays, linked lists, string)
2. keywords such as: *longest/shortets subset*, *subarray*, or value, etc...
