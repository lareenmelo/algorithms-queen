# how memory works
When we're about to store values in memory we first check if there's any space available. If there's space available the memory will return an address with the available slot(s) so we can save our things.
 
*// QUESTIONS: how does memory works for arrays, linked lists? what is memory? what do we store in memory?*
For `arrays`, we want to store things contiguously (one after another)
For `linked lists`, data is linked and stored anywhere in the available slot in memory
