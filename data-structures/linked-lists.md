# linked lists
### what are they?
`linked lists` are a linear data structure that consists of a collection of nodes, where each node holds its own value and a reference to the following node. Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored contiguously in memory, meaning, items aren't placed one after another, instead, because he hold a reference (the address in memory) on each node, we do a look-up in memory with the address.

### types of linked lists 
1. singly linked lists
2. doubly linked lists
3. circular linked lists (singly and doubly)

### performance
- searching: O(n)
- traversing: O(n)
- inserting: O(1)
- deleting: O(1)
