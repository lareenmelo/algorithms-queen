# arrays

### what is it?
they're an abstract data structure that allows us to store data of the same type contiguously in memory. They're defined all together under a name. 

Arrays can be fixed (cannot be shrinked or expanded) and dynamic sized (*QUESTIONS: okay, what does fixed vs dynamic mean? Also, why can't an array be shrinked*)

### pros vs cons
|pros|cons|
|:--:|:--:|
|1. allows randome access (*QUESTION: what is this??*), 2. better cache locality (*QUESTION: what is this??*), 3. collection of data under a label (variable name) | 1. fixed sizing |

### performance
* insertion - O(1) (*QUESTION: really?!*)
* deletion - O(n)
* access - O(1)
* search - O(n)
