# binary search

### What is it?
binary is a search algorithm that repeteadly divides our search by half intervals the portion of our input that could potentially include the item we're looking for. 
For a binary search algorithm to work, our input needs to be sorted. 

The time complexity for a binary search is O(log n).

~binary search is more efficient than a linear search (which is O(n))~
