# quicksort

### what is it?
it's a sorting algorithm that uses the `divide and conquer` principle. It consists of having a base case and recursively reducing your problem to be your base case. It uses a method/concept of partition, where given an array, we choose a pivot and sort the array accordingly (with the greater items in one and the smaller ones in another)

### complexity
worst case scenario: O(n^2^)
